# Company-Data-Management-System
A team project for a database course (Jan 2024). We built a system to manage a companyâ€™s data, including orders, employee records, reports, and more. My role focused on managing employees and orders, ensuring efficient data handling and organization. The project showcases database design, SQL, and java backend skills.
